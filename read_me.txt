Generate the input files using generate_inputs.
The file scale_bcv defines the velocity along the model; modify this file to set a constant velocity for the constant-rate models.
The file scale_bcv_araujo defines the velocity evolution along the model.
Use the shell script to initiate the model.

Both the input generation and the post-processing scripts were developed by Victor Sacek.
The post-processing scripts to plot heat flow, topography and Strain rate at a certain depth were developed by Jo√£o Paulo de Souza Bueno.
